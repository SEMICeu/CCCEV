They represent hard conditions such as minimum or maximum expressions which can be used to evaluate pieces of information, the required age, income, involvement in activities, etc. An example from the eProcurement domain is a threshold as the minimum turnover required by the buying organisation to select the candidates.

Criteria usually set minimum conditions (e.g. limits, intervals, thresholds, etc.) that need to be met in order to pass the requirements or to fulfil them to a certain degree or quality. The concept of Criteria is broader than the concept of Constraint since it covers more usages. The evaluation of the fulfilment is usually supported by the provision of Evidence. 
For example in the eProcurement domain, the eProcurement Ontology defines different subclasses of Criterion such as exclusion grounds, selection criteria or award criteria. A concrete example of a Criterion is 'participation in a criminal organisation' which could also be considered as an exclusion ground criterion in the procurement domain or for requiring a public service."""@en .

They represent requests for data that prove one or more facts of the real world in a formal manner, or that leads to the source of such a proof. They can be understood as 'requests for Evidences'. The response to an Information Requirement is an Evidence when the issuer of the response is an authoritative source (e.g. a Civil Registry providing data about a natural person for the provision of public service through the Single Digital Gateway). In other cases, the responses might not be issued by an authoritative source, but the issuer supports the responses with Evidences (or commits to support them timely, e.g. a self-declaration or a declaration of oath). The Information Requirement can require structured data or documents of any form. For structured data, the Requirement can use 'Concepts' to specify the structure and type of the data expected in the response. For both structured and unstructured data, the Information Requirement can indicate the expected Type of Evidence, its format, source, and other properties related to the Evidence."@en .

Also note that the Requirement class is specified at a more abstract level and is not to be used as the instantiation of a Requirement for a specific Agent.   The European Directive on services in the internal market  defines requirement as any obligation, prohibition, condition or limit provided for in the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States or in consequence of case-law, administrative practice, the rules of professional bodies, or the collective rules of professional associations or other professional organisations, adopted in the exercise of their legal autonomy."@en .

(a) the Requirement processor, i.e. the Agent setting out Requirements for an objective and processing the supplied Evidences in the context of the Requirements, and 
(b) the Evidence provider, i.e. the Agent supplying information to an information request expressed as Requirements.

The Requirement processor has expressed its expectations (both business as technical) for the information it wants to recieve as an Information Concept. The Evidence provider is able to supply information for that Information Concept, but its native data representation might not be coherent with the expectations set by the Requirement processor. The Supported Value is bridging both. 

The Evidence provider can either provide a derived value (fact) from its native data representation that complies with the Information Concept expectations. Or it can provide a query in an agreed language between Evidence provider and Requirement processor that allows the Requirement processor to retrieve the value from the native data representation.

Implementers are free to choose their language. It is recommended to document the made agreements well.

Other usage could be to harmonise the supplied values (e.g. rounding, turning to percentages) to facilitate further processing.

Implementers are free to use their own approach for defining the expected values in more details.
