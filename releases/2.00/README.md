# How to tackle CCCEV?

If you are new to CCCEV, in semantic modelling or simply wonder how to tackle the reading of CCCEV, we would advise you the following default order:

1. [CCCEV Explanatory example](https://github.com/SEMICeu/CCCEV/raw/master/releases/2.00/html/CCCEV_AnExplanatoryExample.pdf) presenting the current version 2.00.
2. [Changelog from CCCEV 1.00 to this version 2.00](https://github.com/SEMICeu/CCCEV/blob/master/releases/2.00/Changelog.md) with the motivations which led to the current version as well as a comparison between v1.00 and v2.00.
3. The full [HTML specification of CCCEV 2.00](https://semiceu.github.io/CCCEV/releases/2.00/) describing in detail the version 2.00 with usage notes.

Two remarks: 

*    You can access the previous version of CCCEV 1.00 from [here](https://github.com/SEMICeu/CCCEV/tree/master/releases/1.00). 
*    While going through the different documents, you will probably need to go back and forth, e.g. using the changelog as a reference for navigating and comparing CCCEV v1.00 and 2.00.

If you have any comments on CCCEV 2.00, please open an issue from [here](https://github.com/SEMICeu/CCCEV/issues).
