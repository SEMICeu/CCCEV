# New to CCCEV?

If you are new to CCCEV, we would advise you to go through these materials in the following order:

1. [CCCEV Explanatory example](https://github.com/SEMICeu/CCCEV/blob/master/releases/2.00/CCCEV_AnExplanatoryExample.pdf) presenting the current version 2.00.
2. [Changelog from CCCEV 1.00 to this version 2.00](https://github.com/SEMICeu/CCCEV/blob/master/releases/2.00/Changelog.md) with the motivations which led to the current version as well as a comparison between v1.00 and v2.00.
3. The full [HTML specification of CCCEV 2.00](https://semiceu.github.io/CCCEV/releases/2.00/) describing in detail the version 2.00 with usage notes.

Two remarks: 

*    You can access the previous version of CCCEV 1.00 from [here](https://github.com/SEMICeu/CCCEV/tree/master/releases/1.00). 
*    While going through the different documents, you will probably need to go back and forth, e.g. using the changelog as a reference for navigating and comparing CCCEV v1.00 and 2.00.
