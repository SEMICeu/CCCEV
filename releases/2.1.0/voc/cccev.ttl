  <http://purl.org/vocab/vann/usageNote> "Information Requirements are the most neutral kind of Requirements. They aim to request information in any form, e.g. a person's date of birth or a company's turnover. They represent requests for data that prove one or more facts of the real world in a formal manner, or that leads to the source of such a proof. They can be understood as 'requests for Evidences'. The response to an Information Requirement is an Evidence when the issuer of the response is an authoritative source (e.g. a Civil Registry providing data about a natural person for the provision of public service through the Single Digital Gateway). In other cases, the responses might not be issued by an authoritative source, but the issuer supports the responses with Evidences (or commits to support them timely, e.g. a self-declaration or a declaration of oath). The Information Requirement can require structured data or documents of any form. For structured data, the Requirement can use 'Concepts' to specify the structure and type of the data expected in the response. For both structured and unstructured data, the Information Requirement can indicate the expected Type of Evidence, its format, source, and other properties related to the Evidence."@en;

Other usage could be to harmonise the supplied values (e.g. rounding, turning to percentages) to facilitate further processing.

Implementers are free to use their own approach for defining the expected values in more details. For instance, this can be by defining their own datatypes extending or encapsulating common xsd datatypes.
