# Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV)

The Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV) is designed to support the exchange of information between organisations defining criteria and organisations responding to these criteria by means of evidences.


CCCEV contains two basic and complementary core concepts:

*    the Requirement, a broad notion encompassing all forms of requests for information, that is often, but not necessarily, made with the objective to use it as a basis for making a judgement or decision; and
*    the Evidence, the data proving or disproving that a specific Requirement is met by someone or something, and thus has been fulfilled.

Using these basic core concepts, CCCEV provides a generic setting to define Criteria, i.e. Requirements with an assessment or evaluation objective in mind. This is a key motivation for CCCEV. 


The latest specification is CCCEV 2.0.0 can be found at [https://semiceu.github.io/CCCEV/releases/2.00/](https://semiceu.github.io/CCCEV/releases/2.00/). 
CCCEV is part of the [ISA Core Vocabularies](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/solution/e-government-core-vocabularies) managed by SEMIC. 

The Latest editor draft is CCCEV 2.1.0 and can be found at [here](https://semiceu.github.io/CCCEV/releases/2.1.0/)

Discussions about the version 2.1.0 of CCCEV took place during the webinar of the 27th of October 2021[available here](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semic-support-centre/event/webinar-review-core-vocabularies).

The activities the SEMIC community organises around this specification are published on [Joinup](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/solution/core-criterion-and-core-evidence-vocabulary).
